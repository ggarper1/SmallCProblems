# 🧩 Small Problem Solutions

This repository is a collection of solutions written in C to various small programming and algorithmic problems. Each problem is contained within its own file. Additionally, I've created my own data structures from scratch to solve these small problems. For more info about these data structures see [UTILS.md](https://github.com/ggarper1/SmallCProjects/blob/main/UTILS.md)

# TODO:
  1. Change binary tree so that repeated elements are not added.
  2. Change so all data structures don't have `_t`.
